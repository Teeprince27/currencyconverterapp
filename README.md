# Currency Converter App (Compose Multiplatform application)

Welcome to the documentation for the Jetpack Compose Multiplatform Currency Converter Application!
This is a cross-platform application that is built using Jetpack Compose Multiplatform. It includes shared business logic and data handling, and a shared UI implementation using Compose Multiplatform.
The application allows users to covert currency etc on Android, iOS.


# Tech Stack 📚

Compose Multiplatform for UI

Ktor for networking
kotlinx.serialization for JSON handling
Kamel for image loading
Koin for dependency injection
Voyager for navigation and screen models
Coil for image/videos/gif processing
Datastore for storing data asynchronously, consistently, and transactional
Kotest for comprehensive testing tool
Kotlin Coroutines
Fake Data


# Development 💻

My goal is to create a high-quality, multiplatform Currency Converter Application that demonstrates the power and flexibility of Jetpack Compose.

# Challenges Faced 👨‍💻

During the development of this project,
I encountered several challenges that required creative solutions.
Some of the key challenges I addressed include:


Native Functionality Challenges: Implementing native functionalities posed challenges in status bar customization.

UI Testing: Developing comprehensive UI tests across multiple platforms presented challenges in ensuring consistent behavior and visual presentation.

Unit Testing: Writing unit tests for shared code and platform-specific implementations required careful consideration of differences in testing frameworks and environments.

These challenges underscored the complexity of developing a cross-platform Currency Converter application and pushed me to innovate and refine my solutions continually.

# Architecture 🏢

The Jetpack Compose Multiplatform Currency Converter Application is built using the Clean Architecture and the MVI (Model-View-Intent) pattern.


# Testing 🧪
Testing is a crucial aspect of software development to ensure the reliability and functionality of the application.
In the Ecobank Business project, we utilize various testing frameworks and tools to maintain the quality of our codebase.
